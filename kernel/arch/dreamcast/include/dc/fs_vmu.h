    \brief   VMU filesystem driver.
    \ingroup vfs_vmu

    The VMU filesystem driver mounts itself on /vmu of the VFS. Each memory card
    has its own subdirectory off of that directory (i.e, /vmu/a1 for slot 1 of
    the first controller). VMUs themselves have no subdirectories, so the driver
    itself is fairly simple.

    Files on a VMU must be multiples of 512 bytes in size, and should have a
    header attached so that they show up in the BIOS menu.

    This layer is built off of the vmufs layer, which does all the low-level
    operations. It is generally easier to work with things at this level though,
    so that you can use the normal libc file access functions.
